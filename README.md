IF YOU INTEND TO USE THE PROFILE.SAV, BACK UP YOUR OWN FIRST

Good luck fixing it otherwise! :D

295.sav 29 Aug 2025 - a save files with LootLemon gear for someone

201.sav - 19 Aug 2025 - same as below but at level 72

200.sav - 19 Aug 2025 - WHAT'S IN THIS:

1. Modded Moze character. EXTRA skill points, if you level up or respec, any unspent EXTRA points will be lost on save-exit. You won't go lower than the max you're supposed to have, but only reloading the save (or using a cheat) will get you EXTRA skill points. You start on Sanctuary but before doing anything else.

2. A bunch of modded gear. Some of it is DLC dependent, some is DLC dependant so sorry if you don't have the DLC. :( It's honestly worth it, it'll be on sale soon. :) Other than the exception below, don't sell this gear. It's worth more than the max money you can have and you'll have $0 and no gear. :P 

3. A bunch of modded level 6 Moze class mods, worth $314M each. $300M is??? enough to max your SDUs, but since the SDUs on this character are maxed, just put them in the Bank for later or giving to freinds. Your max money is about $2.16B so if you sell 6 at once you'll go over and have $0 and no gear. :P

4. $1B, see notes above about $ max.

5. $1B eridium and a Gun-Gun

==================

Older files, no promises ^_^

profile.sav - keys and whatnot, I mainly put it here for the Bank of modded gear. Some of it is kinda bananas, most of it will crash your money if you sell it. :)

130.sav - lvl 72 modded gear? probably out of date

29.sav - almost the start of TVH

590.sav just a random upload :P

360.sav - endgame assist, pretty sure it's "clean" for side quests? Iffy on the modded gear, some max, some not
