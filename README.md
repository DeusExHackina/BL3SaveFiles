IF YOU INTEND TO USE THE PROFILE.SAV, BACK UP YOUR OWN FIRST

Good luck fixing it otherwise! :D

profile.sav - keys and whatnot, I mainly put it here for the Bank of modded gear. Some of it is kinda bananas, most of it will crash your money if you sell it. :)

130.sav - lvl 72 modded gear? probably out of date

29.sav - almost the start of TVH

590.sav just a random upload :P

360.sav - endgame assist, pretty sure it's "clean" for side quests? Iffy on the modded gear, some max, some not
